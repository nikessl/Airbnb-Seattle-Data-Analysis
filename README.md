### Project Motivation:
This project is part of the Data Science Nanodegree I am doing at Udacity. I chose the dataset "Seattle Airbnb Open Data" as part of a submission to apply the concepts I learned. The aim of the small analysis was to find out which aspects lead to high prices for flats in Seattle.

### Files 
Included is the code that I wrote in python, the README file, that you are reading right now
